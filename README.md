# EVM-subnet

## Tools Used
- Unix Computer (MacOS or Linux)
- Solidity
- Remix
- Metamask
- Web Browser

## Your Project: Step by Step

### 1. Deploy your EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI
Make sure you have the Avalanche CLI installed and configured. Use it to deploy your EVM subnet.

### 2. Add your Subnet to Metamask
Open Metamask and add your subnet network. You'll need the custom RPC settings provided by Avalanche.

### 3. Make sure it is your selected network in Metamask
Ensure that your newly added subnet is selected as the active network in Metamask.

### 4. Connect Remix to your Metamask
In Remix, connect to Metamask using the Injected Provider option.

### 5. Deploy the smart contracts
Compile your Solidity smart contracts in Remix and deploy them to your deployed EVM subnet.

### 6. Test your application!
Use Remix to interact with your deployed smart contracts. Deploy tokens, pools, and any other functionalities you've implemented. Test thoroughly to ensure everything functions as expected.
